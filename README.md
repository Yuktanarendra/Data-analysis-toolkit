# Data Analysis and Cleaning Toolkit

This project is a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit, aimed at simplifying the process of data analysis, cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling. It accepts a `.csv` file as input and provides insights into the data, along with options to apply machine learning algorithms for prediction.

## Features

- **CSV File Upload:** Accepts `.csv` files and reads them for analysis.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing values, duplicates, and allows for column-specific cleaning.
- **Data Visualization:** Uses Seaborn and Matplotlib to generate visual insights such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Provides basic statistics, correlation heatmaps, and data distribution visuals.
- **Machine Learning Predictions:** Allows users to apply classification and regression models from Scikit-learn to the cleaned data for predictive analytics.

## Technologies Used

- **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/):** For building the interactive web interface.
- **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/):** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/):** For creating statistical visualizations.
- **[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/):** For plotting graphs and visualizations.
- **[Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/):** For applying machine learning models to predict outcomes.
- **Python:** As the primary programming language.

## How It Works

1. **Upload a CSV file:** 
   - The application accepts a `.csv` file as input for analysis.
  
2. **Data Cleaning:** 
   - Users can opt to clean the data by handling missing values (imputation, removal) and removing duplicate rows.

3. **Data Visualization:** 
   - Visualize relationships between features with scatter plots, histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

4. **Data Insights:** 
   - Summary statistics and visual insights are provided to understand data distributions, patterns, and correlations.

5. **Machine Learning Predictions:**
   - Users can apply machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forest) on the cleaned data for prediction purposes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Yuktanarendra/Data-analysis-toolkit.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd data analysis toolkit
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Launch the application using the command above.
2. Upload a `.csv` file.
3. Perform data cleaning by selecting relevant options.
4. Visualize the data using various plotting techniques.
5. Choose a machine learning algorithm for prediction and evaluate the model's performance.
